# Switter developed by Jiajun Niu using Ruby on Rails 3.2 

This is a social network project based on my work in proprietary wegroup(my part of wegroup and my own implementations replacing others' codes in wegroup) and some books: ROR3 tutorial, Agile Web Development with Rails, Rails Recipes. 

I'm trying to build my own SNS website template with detailed comments and companion instructions, in Test-driven Development/Behavior-driven Development way.

Related tools include Ajax, Twitter Bootstrap, RSpec, Factory Girl, etc...
